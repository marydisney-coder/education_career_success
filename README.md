# education_career_success
A machine learning project that analyzes educational, skill-based, and career factors to predict an individual’s current job level. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, Logistic Regression modeling, and a Streamlit app for interactive career level prediction.
Here is a **clear, professional README.md** you can use for your **Career Level Prediction** project 👇

#  Career Level Prediction Using Machine Learning:

##  Project Overview:

This project predicts an individual’s **Current Job Level** based on educational background, skills, and career-related factors using Machine Learning. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and an interactive **Streamlit web application** for predictions.

##  Objectives:

* Analyze factors influencing career progression
* Clean and preprocess career-related data
* Build a classification model to predict job level
* Deploy an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions

##  Technologies Used:

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit

##  Dataset:

* **Education & Career Success Dataset**
* Key features include:

  * Academic performance (GPA, SAT scores)
  * Internships, projects, certifications
  * Soft skills and networking score
  * Job offers, salary, work-life balance
* **Target Variable:** Current Job Level

##  Data Processing:

* Handled missing values using imputation
* Encoded categorical variables
* Scaled numerical features
* Performed correlation analysis and visualizations

##  Model:

* **Logistic Regression (Classification)**
* Trained on standardized features
* Evaluated using accuracy score

##  Streamlit Web App:

The Streamlit app allows users to:

* Enter academic and career details
* Predict the **Current Job Level**
* View results instantly in an interactive interface

##  How to Run the Project:

###  Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn streamlit
```

###  Train the Model:

```bash
python colabcodeprj2.py
```

###  Run Streamlit App:

```bash
streamlit run streamlitcodeprj2.py
```

##  Results:

* The model identifies strong relationships between skills, experience, and job level.
* Features such as certifications, networking score, and salary significantly influence predictions.


##  Future Improvements:

* Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Add feature importance visualization
* Deploy the app on cloud platforms
